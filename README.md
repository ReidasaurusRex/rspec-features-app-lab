# RSpec Features App Lab

The goal for this lab was to build an application thinking about what the user will do in the application, and building a series of features specifications (specs) to specify the userâ€™s actions. 

The resulting tests derived are relatively simple: seeing whether the proper content displays on the redirected page as a result of the zipcode entered being above or below an aribtrarily designated 50000. 

Some conditional logic was used in the redirected view to satisfy both conditions of the 'sunny' and 'raining' conditions.
